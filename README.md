# Blue Bank Loans

## Project Brief

Blue Bank is a bank in USA that has a loan department which is currently understaffed.
They supply loans to individuals and don’t have much reporting on how risky these
borrowers are.
Using Python and Tableau, they’d like to see a report of borrowers who may have
issues paying back the loan.

## Details

In the file *blue_bank_script.py* there is the Python script where I use Pandas and Numpy to transform and normalize the data.
